This mod complete changes the combat meta of HMO.
Units are much more closely matched and counters are key to winning battles and wars.

## Center units:
HI: Are now considered swordsmen. They counter spearmen. Take less morale damage and deal more damage.

LI: Are now considered spearmen. They counter cavalry. Take less morale damage.

HC: Center formation horsemen. They counter swordsmen. Take less morale damage and deal more morale damage.

## Flank units:
LC: Do a lot of damage but will retreat quickly. If they win the flanks they will decimate the enemy center.

C: They are roughly the same as LC.

## Skirmish units:
A: Or generally "skirmishers". They do a lot of damage but will flee the battle quickly.

## Special units:
HA: They don't take a lot of damage but will flee more quickly. They won't win many battles but will trade well on manpower.

WE: Ultimate battering rams. Will delete front lines, but don't do a ton of manpower damage. They themselves are tough and don't lose much manpower, but won't stick around long.
